Opportunities abound to build upon this infrastructure - GoodDollar enables you to leverage our technical, financial, and active community resources.

Team up and start building! <br><br>And don't forget to join the GoodDollar Hackers Group for support!<br><br><br><strong>Challenge Ideas:</strong> <br><br>1. <strong>Perpetual Quadratic Funding Rounds Using Allo and G$ Supertoken</strong> <br>Imagine if users could continually vote for projects by continuously streaming funds to them, eliminating the need to return and vote each round. Each round would calculate the pool and votes streamed during that period. GoodDollar, as a native superfluid token on Celo, can be extended with Allo functionality to create a Superapp and develop a user interface for project support. Additionally, GoodDollar's unique anti-sybil identity can be employed to prevent double voting in quadratic funding. Consider submitting your work to the Celo Allo UI challenge and the Best Public Good Funding challenge as well.</p><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Utilize G$ streams to bolster projects.</p></li><li><p>Utilize G$ Identity to prevent double voting.</p></li><li><p>Enable voting based on round streams.</p></li><li><p>Create a UI to facilitate project support.</p></li><li><p>Develop a Superapp based on Allo and quadratic funding.</p></li><li><p>Adhere to the general acceptance criteria (outlined below).</p></li></ul><p>2. <strong>Simplified GoodCollective Pool Creation</strong><br>GoodCollective offers a new approach to UBI as a service - direct, automatic payments to specific individuals based on actions. While the app for supporting these pools is in progress, we lack an interface for creating new pools.<br><br><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Design a straightforward interface for creating GoodCollective pools.</p></li><li><p>Build on the existing code base.</p></li><li><p>Allow customization of pool parameters as per GoodCollective smart contracts.</p></li><li><p>Store pool descriptions and static attributes as JSON on IPFS.</p></li><li><p>Meet the general acceptance criteria (see below).<br></p></li></ul><p>3. <strong>Worldcoin Identity Integration</strong><br>Worldcoin introduces a more secure sybil resistance identity compared to GoodDollar's face verification approach. Extend the GoodDollar app and protocol to accommodate Worldcoin IDs. For example, G$ verified members who link their Worldcoin IDs could receive an extra 20% daily UBI upon payment of a 10 Worldcoin token registration fee.<br><br><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Develop an easy-to-use UI for connecting a Worldcoin ID.</p></li><li><p>Create a smart contract registry for unique Worldcoin ID proofs, linkable to G$ verified accounts.</p></li><li><p>Modify the UBIScheme contract to support Worldcoin IDs.</p></li><li><p>Meet the general acceptance criteria (see below)</p></li></ul>","acceptanceCriteria":"<p>All summations must also adhere to these criteria.
