# BountyX
BountyX is an open source project supporting the public goods and retroactive funding ecosystem. As a first step, BountyX is supporting hackathon projects by providing HyperCerts to teams and their participants. The product allows owners to mint a hypercert for their project and helps kickstart interest and potentially funding for the future.
