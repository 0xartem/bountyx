These components can interact with your smart contracts or an existing Ethereum project, and then be embedded in your dapp or hackathon project. There are also many components available to learn from on near.social (check out the resources!). We believe developers should be able to store critical frontend code on-chain. So we built Open Web Components, a technology stack for deploying decentralized frontend components on NEAR Protocol. If you need NEAR tokens to support your hack and this bounty, come to the NEAR booth to get a free NEAR Wallet with enough tokens to support your deployment. This is a great way to learn about modular development of your dapps, and how easy it is to use NEAR to deploy frontend components.

Nice to have: how you use Chainlink in the project description. It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid. You must present your project for the Chainlink judges! Projects whose team does not present will not be evaluated. We will look at the following criteria: - UI/UX/DX - How useful is your application? Is it visually appealing? - Blockchain technology application - How valuable this project is for decentralization and adoption of Blockchain and Web3 - Wow Factor - Anything not covered above! This is if you blow us away in some other way. Extra Alpha Users Prize: Since Chainlink Functions has just launched, we are celebrating alpha users by giving them a special backpack. For those of you that use Chainlink Functions in their dApp, you can go to our location (to be decided) on Sunday and pick up your backpack. Note that we only have a limited supply, so please hurry :) Resources Chainlink Functions -Samples Repo Chainlink Functions - Documentation Also you can get started with any resources by checking out the hackathon resources page. You’ll find: Documentation for all the Chainlink features Smart Contract Starter Tutorial Best practices utilized by top protocols like Aave and Synthetix Hardhat Starter Kits Brownie Starter Kits Truffle Starter Kits dApp Tools Starter Kit And unlimited demos. There are plenty of video resources on that page for step-by-step working and building with: - NFTs - DeFi - DAOs - Gaming - And more! Have fun 🙂 \"</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>For first timers:</strong></p><p>If this is your first time at a hackathon or with your teammates, this blog post on organizing a hackathon team may be beneficial(https://tesla809.medium.com/draft-crash-course-how-to-organize-a-hackathon-team-29b221c23905). In our experience, a clear method of collaboration increases the chances of teams completing their projects, improves team efficiency, and reduces the time to completion.</p><p><strong>TD;LR:</strong> Innovations in wallet design for better UX/UI, plus lower fees, will help onboard the next billion users. Because good UX/UI like is magic. It just works.</p><p>✨The Magic: <strong>Account Abstraction</strong> unlocks innovations in wallet design by bringing web2 UX/UI convenience to web3, so that self custody is much easier and decentralization increases.</p><p>🤫 The Secret: Account Abstraction allows organizations to create curated web3 experiences to create smooth onboarding. <strong>With AA, we can adapt accounts to business logic needs, instead of adapting business logic needs to accounts.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>🔍 The Deets: By treating smart contract accounts at the same level as Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), we can break free from the EOA’s hardcoded assumptions. Accounts are abstracted because now the implementation and the interface are decoupled, allowing for customizable accounts only limited by your imagination.</p><p>A great example of Account Abstraction can be found in Raise Finance’s Blog: https://raisefinance.medium.com/the-power-of-account-abstraction-technical-overview-of-the-raisepay-wallet-8e8c43dee64f<br><br><strong>Dapp suggestions:</strong></p><p>Think of your own idea! Optionally, you can pick one of a few of the hackathon idea suggestions as prompts to user stories via the following categories:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Security</strong> to increase safety and self custody for users</p></li><li><p><strong>Onboarding</strong> to attract users and simplify interactions, reduced number of steps, or clicks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retention</strong> to keep them</p></li></ul><p>Improve <strong>security using Account Abstraction</strong> via one or more of these:</p><ul><li><p>One idea is a general abstraction in multisig wallets for plug and play services: easily add fraud monitoring, KYC, or any arbitrary service.</p></li><li><p>This general abstraction can be used for multi-factor authentication via any medium: Gmail, Google Auth, etc.</p></li><li><p>Another application could be fraud monitoring or KYC service, where the service is one of the multi-sigs wallet signers: if configurable compliance rules work, sign. For example, if transactions are under a certain amount or accounts are not on OFAC list.</p></li><li><p>Another idea is a general purpose custom wallet generator: easy to create inter-linked custom accounts customizable functionality, using visual GUI tools. Think IFTT meets ETH.Build, meets Your Favorite Wallet.</p></li><li><p>An application would be the easy generation of compliant intra-web of accounts for organizations. This allows the segregation of funds and easier control of risk. Some accounts can only pay certain vendors, employee payroll, investments only in certain assets, taking deposits, etc. How can you map the payment flows of an organization to an intra-web of accounts?</p></li><li><p>We’d love to see any cool and innovative ideas you can dream of.</p></li><li><p>Some prompts to get your imagination going are: Deadman switches, interesting forms of social recovery, Emergency Escape Hatches from L2 → L1, Innovative Curve and Encryption Schemes, customizable allow / deny lists for DApps, social methods of crowdsourcing allow / deny lists, trading margin limits based on number of multi-signature signers, easy methods to generate new accounts based on DApps, safety vaults for safe storage like customizable time locks on certain assets to prevent stealing.</p></li></ul><p><em>Improve </em><strong><em>onboarding using Account Abstraction and Paymasters</em></strong><em> via one or more of these:</em></p><ul><li><p>paying the gas fees for users with Paymasters.</p></li><li><p>paying bills and fees with ERC20 tokens like USDC.</p></li><li><p>session keys: easily generate sessions keys to approve all transactions under certain customizable conditions. Super useful for gaming or immersive experiences.</p></li><li><p>multi-calls: no more signing several transactions, now you can batch transactions for flow.</p></li><li><p>Any out-of-the-box ideas you can dream of. Impress the world!</p></li></ul><p><em>Improve </em><strong><em>retention</em></strong><em> via one or more of these:</em></p><ul><li><p>Using Paymasters to reward on-chain activity like: pay fees or percentage of fees for users that meet a certain threshold.</p></li><li><p>Using Account Abstraction to help increase utility of assets.</p></li></ul>",

        "description": "<p>Number of Bounties:</p><p>This bounty will be distributed according to the amount and quality of submissions. <br><br>CoW Protocol is the only trading protocol designed with DAOs in mind. This is why it's the best way for DAOs to engage with it, since the world of possibilities that it has to offer is endless. Since ETH Denver is THEE conference of DAOs, we thought it was right to focus on enabling DAOs to go to their next level. With ERC-1271 integration into CoW Protocol, DAOs, smart contracts and the combination of both, are now able to sign messages as if they were EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts, like MetaMask). On CoW Swap, EOA users never pay for failed transactions because they sign messages to place their orders — but smart contracts don’t get these same benefits, since (before ERC-1271) they must place their order with an on-chain transaction (by calling the preSignature method). While this might have been a stopper in the past, using ERC1271 allows anyone to build any sort of tools that eases the management of DAO treasuries, their trading strategies, or even their buyback programs. We will award $7500 to the team that builds the most-creative demo of ERC-1271 automation tools for DAOs to be able to place orders on CoW Protocol – i.e. stop losses, Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) orders, Good After Time (GAT) orders, etc. Attach a front end to the product and earn an extra $2500!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Integrate BOB stablecoin and zkBob Direct Deposits functionality into your application. Demonstrate how your app users can benefit from optional transactional privacy with zkBob. </p><p></p><p>BOB is a decentralized stablecoin with opt-in anonymity and confidentiality features powered by a protocol based on zk-SNARKs. One of the disadvantages of these types of protocols is the sender needs to calculate a proof using their secret key each time, making it difficult to use a smart contract to automate such payments. We've done our best to eliminate this problem by introducing the Direct Deposit feature. You can now send funds to anyone in the privacy pool directly from the smart contract. This feature makes the zkBob protocol much more composable and suitable for integration where funds transfer can be included as a subroutine to other decentralized protocols. See more details in the documentation. </p><p></p><p>Some ideas (we'd ❤️ to see any other novel use cases) to start brainstorming from: </p><p>- Integration within open-source wallets </p><p>- Apps for DAO accounting </p><p>- Browser extension for zkBob </p><p>- Donation/fundraising/tipping apps </p><p>- Privacy for P2P micro-transactions </p><p>- Integration with DEXs/bridges/aggregators </p><p></p><p>Bounty </p><p>1st prize - 5,000 BOB </p><p>2nd prize - 2,000 BOB </p><p>Notable projects: pool of 3,000 BOB will be evenly distributed among all other notable submissions </p><p></p>",
        "acceptanceCriteria": "<p>- Creativity, novelty, usefulness for end users and implementation quality. </p><p>- Importance of zkBob integration to the overall application/product (i.e. is it integral to app functionality, usefulness and purpose or is it an add-on without a lot of added value). </p><p>- Coherent integrations between zkBob and other existing protocols/dApps are appreciated </p><p>- Alignment with the BOB and zkBob ecosystem values of on-chain privacy protection within accepted limits. </p><p>- *extra credit will apply to solutions using other zkBob components on top of integration with direct deposits (zkBob SDK libraries, gift cards, compliance tooling, deep smart contract integrations, etc.)</p>",

        "description": "<p>This bounty can be split into sub-bounties by each individual RPC request type (e.g. view access key, view access keys list, transaction in the block, view state, etc). Each sub-bounty can be implemented by a different team. In order to benefit from having Near light client integrated into near-api-js, we need the RPC interface of Near node to return proofs for most of the RPC replies (e.g. have an option to do it when “proof” parameter is passed). For example, the proof of a transaction being included into the block would consist of: merkle path towards transaction in a shard, merkle path towards shard hash. For access keys and viewing state you would need to provide the path in merkle patricia trie. We have already implemented proof for Transaction Status, which you can use as an example: https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/transactions#transaction-status.</p>",

It can be any Chainlink services, except Chainlink Functions, which has his own bounty. If you would like to use both, you can submit to both tracks, but the judges will choose different projects, so if you are the best in one Chainlink bounty, will not be awarded in the other. Nice to have: how you use Chainlink in the project description. It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid. You must present your project for the Chainlink judges! Projects whose team does not present will not be evaluated. We will look at the following criteria: - UI/UX/DX - How useful is your application? Is it visually appealing? - Blockchain technology application - How valuable this project is for decentralization and adoption of Blockchain and Web3 - Wow Factor - Anything not covered above! This is if you blow us away in some other way. <br><br><strong>Resources</strong><br><br>You can get started with any resources by checking out the hackathon resources page.

Many token holders don’t necessarily have the time to spend reviewing each proposal in depth, which is why some would rather delegate their voting power to someone else.<br><br>The objective is: build a delegate governance model for Aragon DAOs. Token holders should be able to delegate their tokens to representatives they trust to vote in proposals representing their voice. In order to do this, you’ll likely have to build a token wrapper contract as well as an Aragon governance plugin.<br><br>The token wrapper contract is for the DAO’s voting tokens (you can choose whether to focus on ERC-20s or ERC-721s or both). This wrapper contract should enable delegating functionality so that the token can represent the vote of someone else, without that person having to actually transfer the token to someone else. <br><br>Then, build a governance mechanism plugin that counts how many tokens have been delegated to an address when counting the votes for a given proposal.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Moonbeam has a variety of precompiles, such as the batch precompile and call permit precompile that offer powerful functionality to builders which can vastly improve the UX for dApp users. The batch precompile allows you to combine multiple smart contract calls into a single transaction. These groupings can be atomic or nonatomic at your discretion. <br><br>The quintessential example of a batched transaction that simplifies the UX for end users is batching together the approval and swap transactions for DEX. Rather than a user having to confirm an approval transaction and a swap transaction, the user can confirm a single batched transaction that executes both within the same block. In this case, you’d want the batch transaction to be atomic, because there’s no need to approve an ERC-20 allowance if the swap reverts. <br><br>Another possibility is to use the Call Permit Precompile. One of the most frustrating experiences for a user new to Web3 is acquiring gas to pay for transactions. You can substantially improve your dApp’s UX by eliminating the requirement that the user hold the native token for gas. Moonbeam’s call permit precompile enables you to do exactly that - with it, you can dispatch any transaction in a gasless manner which can be relayed by Biconomy.<br><br>To be eligible for this bounty, your dApp should have at least some smart contract logic deployed to Moonbeam or Moonbase Alpha. Secondly, it must utilize the batch precompile or the call permit precompile (or both) to provide any non-trivial functionality to your dApp.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Getting Help </strong>- The <strong>Hackathons </strong>Channel in the Moonbeam Discord is the fastest way to get help.

        "description": "<p>Number of Bounties:<br>This bounty will be distributed according to the amount and quality of submissions.<br><br>CoW Protocol is the only trading protocol designed with DAOs in mind. With CoW Protocol’s ERC1271 implementation, the protocol is set up to offer – in theory – any kind of order that a DAO might want to make. The possibilities are endless. Additionally, since ETH Denver is THE conference of DAOs, we thought it was right to focus on enabling DAOs to go to their next level. The goal for this bounty is to build a Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) module using a new tool built by Zodiac, role modifiers. This new Zodiac module would allow DAOs to grant a role to certain address to unilaterally make calls to any approved addresses (for example: trading protocols, vaults, etc.), approved functions (for example: call swap from this contract only, call approve tokens from this contract only, etc.) and approved access roles. Implementing role modifiers creates the ultimate DAO treasury management setup. Such a module would allow any DAO to permission the activities of the treasury regarding trading, farming or degening – for example: Allow a DAO member (wallet) to trade with CoW Protocol without any additional signers from the multisig (or with one less signer that the current setup) Allow a DAO member (wallet) to always swap stablecoins to stablecoins in CoW Protocol with the treasury manager address Allow a DAO member (wallet) to perform a TWAP order creation with a limited amount of tokens from the ones currently held by the treasury We will award $10,000 to be shared amongst the teams that build and deploy the best Zodiac - Safe module built around CoW Protocol.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Risk management and mitigation are of paramount importance in any development product, and are existential to the blockchain domain. In the last few years, the industry has witnessed a myriad of security breaches and abusive use cases - this has to stop! <br><br>The composability of DeFi enables the BNB dApps to connect with the rest of the ecosystem; however, it also exposes the whole ecosystem as well as its users to various risks. At least three different aspects of risk are important to assessing whether an asset exposes the BNB Chain to undue risk: smart contract risk, counter-party risk, and market risk.<br><br>To address smart contract risk, over the last year, BNB Chain has introduced AvengerDAO security initiative to protect users from financial losses and deter malicious actors and applications, and it has been a huge success. Through partnerships with the leading industry security organizations, we've managed to considerably reduce the number of misdeeds on the BNB Smart Chain. <br><br>During this year we want to address the counter-party and market risks. As part of the challenge you’re to design an implement either one of them as a framework exposing API to the potential users. You can use any methodology as long as it has academical backing with references to the research papers. As bonus points you can add some sort of user interface to visualize the results. <br><br>Please see more details to what counter-party and market risks are.<br>Counter-party risk assesses qualitatively how and by who the asset is governed. There are different degrees of governance decentralization that may give direct control over funds (e.g., as backing) or attack vectors to the governance architecture, which could expose control and funds. Counterparty risk is determined by the level of centralisation, which is measured by the number of parties that control a token’s protocol, as well as the number of holders and the level of trust in the entity, project, community or processes.<br><br>Market risks are linked to the size of a particular asset pool in the protocol, as well as fluctuations in both supply and demand. The markets need to hold sufficient volume to account for any liquidations in the particular pool (i.e., sell offs which tend to lower the price of the underlying asset through slippage affecting the value recovered). Market risk assessments usually involve assessment of the volatility and the liquidity of the assets, but additional extensions are welcome.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Game7 is building the ultimate gamified DAO governance toolbox. Imagine taking your favorite experiences from your favorite games and applying them to DAO governance, community participation and project contribution. <br><br>Imagine embarking on a quest to build a tool that may solve a huge problem for game developers within the Game7 community. Imagine earning XP, Rank, Achievements, Trophies and other rewards for completing key milestones in the project. Imagine if these rewards could be “crafted” into a final NFT that represented your reputation within the Game7 community.&nbsp; <br><br>Now imagine if the system that defined and rewarded this quest had the ability to allow developers in the community to design their own quests. This is where you come in.<br><br>Scope:<br>Build a single quest and build the user experience. Define the quest. Define the tasks needed to complete the quest. Define the acceptance criteria needed to complete each task (jobs). Build the user experience required to complete the quest or the tools needed to measure the completion of the quest.<br><br><strong>Requirements</strong>:<br>Invent a Quest (can be anything fun or valuable to the community)<br>Think of a series of tasks that can be grouped together into a single user experience. Consider behavior you wish to incentivize, actions you wish to reward, milestones and deliverables (acceptance criteria).<br><br>Example of problems we’d like to solve. What quest would you craft, and what tools would you need to integrate to track their progress?<br><br>Our DevRel lead would like to bring more OSS developers building tools for web3 gaming. [GitHub, Discord] <br>Our Community Managers are trying to incentivize participation in Governance and Town Hall meetings. [Discord, Voting Tool]<br>Our Grant Gatekeeper wants to encourage more technical members to help with the due diligence process of grants. [GitHub, Discord, Voting Tool] <br>We seek to engage more game economy auditors<br><br><br>Quest example with a fun user experience to encourage new members to learn about the history, mission, and values of your DAO:<br>I envision a scavenger hunt that rewards a user for finding hidden QR codes throughout an event venue. The quest will be to find all of the hidden QR codes.<br>Each hidden QR code would represent a task.<br>Each QR code would be a chapter in the DAO story. With knowledge of the entire story arc being part of the acceptance criteria.<br>The job will be to read the chapter buried into the QR code.<br>After finding each hidden QR code and reading each chapter in the story, the user will be provided with an achievement fragment.<br>After completing all of the tasks, the user would use the Summon crafting system to mint their final achievement and receive a reward.<br><br>Build Considerations<br>You can add an interesting user experience to your own application or create an exciting user experience in an existing platform/application.<br><br>Examples:<br>- Custom web or mobile application built by your team with the ability to connect to a Summon API. A React app hosted on a Cloudflare page is easy and free.<br>- Discord bot that connects to the Summon API<br>- Chainlink oracles <br>- Lens Protocol <br>- Aragon<br>- Opolis<br>- Skiff<br>- Valist<br>- Mirror.xyz<br>- EmergenceSDK <br>- Slack integration<br>- Github Apps<br>- DAO Voting Apps (Unlock, Discourse, Snapshot, Tally) <br>- Web3 productivity tools such as CharmVerse<br>- Actual game integration<br>- Unity integration</p>",

This is where you come in.<br><br>Scope:<br>You will need to design and implement integration with any web2 or web3 technology. Here are some to spark your imagination:<br>- Custom web or mobile application built by your team with the ability to connect to an Summon API. A React app hosted on a Cloudflare page is easy and free.<br>- Discord bot that connects to the Summon API.<br>- Chainlink oracles <br>- Lens Protocol <br>- Aragon<br>- Opolis<br>- Skiff<br>- Valist<br>- Mirror.xyz<br>- EmergenceSDK <br>- Slack integration<br>- Github Apps<br>- DAO Voting Apps (Unlock, Discourse, Snapshot, Tally) <br>- Web3 productivity tools such as CharmVerse<br>- Actual game integration<br>- Unity integration<br><br><br>Example of problems we’d like to solve:<br><br>- Our DevRel lead would like to bring more OSS developers building tools for web3 gaming. [GitHub, Discord] <br>- Our Community Managers are trying to incentivize participation in Governance and Town Hall meetings. [Discord, Voting Tool]<br>- Our Grant Gatekeeper wants to encourage more technical members to help with the due diligence process of grants. [GitHub, Discord, Voting Tool] <br>- We seek to engage more game economy auditors<br><br>Out of all submissions we will pick 2 to award $1000 each.<br><br>In addition, any project(s) that pass the eligibility criteria and receive a bounty will be prioritized for a subsequent Game7 grant as an extended engagement. We truly believe that any products/tools being built as a part of this prompt will greatly benefit the web3 gaming space. If there are any teams that want to continue building out their projects after the event, we are happy to explore ways for you to obtain funding in the form of grants! <br><br>Extra:<br>If you build your project in the G7DAO Github Repository as an Open Source project that can be incorporated into the Summon system when it goes live, your project will be eligible for additional grant consideration by Game7. Inquire at the Game7 booth.</p>",

        "description": "<p>How do we know that the use of web3 actually helped a social impact project make an impact? To qualify for this grant you have to propose a methodology to measure the social impact gains or losses from integrating web3 into your project. Choose and use Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to measure each web3 integration point of your hackathon project, and describe how you will use them to demonstrate if web3 is supporting the project or hurting it. <br><br>For example, consider a project that is creating a dApp for reporting and rescuing dangerous snakes from a suburb in Florida. This project issues a token for snakes that are rescued and relocated while also raising funds using the dApp. They could create KPIs for: <br>- Funds raised in crypto <br>- Funds raised in fiat <br>- Number of unique donors in crypto <br>- Number of unique donors in fiat <br>- Number of MAU that login with web3 <br>- Number of MAU that login with web2 sign in <br>- Market Cap of the token <br>- Number of snakes rescued by app <br>- Number of snakes rescued by government officials <br>- Amount of donations spent via the app <br>- Amount of taxes spent from the government <br>- Number of reports given via the app <br>- Number of reports given via calling 911 <br>- Average response time and success rate via the app <br>- Average response time and success rate via government officials <br><br>How you interpret these KPIs is important. For example, did the number of snake reports on the dApp decrease because there are less snakes in the area, or because the web3 login is malfunctioning? This bounty will be awarded to the project that proposes the best methodology for measuring the actual impact (positive or negative) that integrating web3 enabled. This methodology is not considering just the overall impact of the project, but rather the impact of using web3 in each layer of the project. BONUS: The winner of this bounty will also have the opportunity to collaborate with social impact experts who are actively working on developing similar measurement models for various international institutions (the UN, World Bank, etc.), national governments and NGOs’.</p>",
